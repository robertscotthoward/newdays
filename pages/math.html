 <p>I really enjoyed making this linear graph- It remind me of a butterfly! Its a bit strange looking- because linear graphs don't usually move like this, all shaky and up and down.(which I acheived using Sin and Cos) But this still counts as linear, because they are straight lines. :)</p>

  <p>Hmm...out of the three this is my least favorite, but I still like it. The Blue and the Green line equations are less than y, while the red and orange are greater than y- this is why the parts are shaded in!</p>

  <p>This one...I mean, choatic. This wasn't supposed to be anything specific originally- It was just me experimenting, but now I think It looks pretty cool. I couldn't include all the equations(There were so, so many) so I included some of the main ones. Had fun with this! :)</p>
