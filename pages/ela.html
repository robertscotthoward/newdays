  It was 2008, during the recession. You were around 2 years old when I bought these cheap plastic keys for you to play with. Unfortunately, you never wanted anything to do with them! It was like in your little baby mind was thinking, “Dad, these are fake keys! I don’t want them, I want your actual keys, your car keys!” 
  And you liked my car keys, because I was always carrying them, and they made that good metal jingle sound. You never saw dad using the plastic keys, and you didn’t want something I didn’t want, so you wanted my keys! <br>
  <p>
  Watching you half heartedly fiddle with the plastic keys on the kitchen table, I thought to myself, “Well, I can’t give her my car keys to play with, because she’ll lose them and I won’t be able to drive to work!”.
  <br> </p> 
 <p> So, I decided I was going to be smart. <br> </p>
 <p>
  I walked around the neighborhood that afternoon, asking my neighbors if they had any old spare keys anywhere that they didn’t need. Keys fitting to broken locks, or keys that had lost their counterpart years ago. Slowly, I went around and collected different shapes and sizes of keys from all our neighbors. Brass, nickel and copper little keys, all unique. 
  </p>
  <p>
  By the end of the day, I had this nice little personal keychain, just for you! There were probably 12 keys on there, each from a different neighbor. And the best thing was, they made that good metal jingle sound you still loved. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  I watched you play with them In the sunlight of the living room, thinking, Man, I’m pretty smart. You think they’re my keys, but they’re not! And if you lose them it’s fine, I can always get more. Plus, you are happy.” <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  Then one day, I see you take out the longest key on there, and start prying off the little plastic child protector outlet cover that Michelle (My wife) and I had so carefully put in each outlet in the house. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Obviously upset, I tell you never to poke around by the outlets anymore,(especially with a metal object like a key) because there are spiders in the outlet, and they’ll get you if you annoy them. (First thing that came to my mind.) <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  But I wasn’t going to let my daughter be killed just because she developed bravery against spiders…
  </p>
  <p>
  I take the keys away from you. I’m bummed out now, because what was I supposed to do? You loved your keys, but I couldn’t have you taking them around the house anymore. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
  So I think to myself again. “I’ll be smarter this time. I will keep your keys in the car with me, so you can play with them while you drive with me to pick your mom up from work. I’ll keep them as car toys, only. This will work!” <br>
    </p>
    <p>
  I won’t be stupid this time! <br>
    </p>
  <p>
  So I put you in your old booster seat, and you grab the keys out of the coffee stained cup holder. Then you start whine/crying and holding your hand, and I realize that the keys are red hot from sitting in the beaming Arizona sun all day. I swear under my breath and take the keys away, burning myself in the process. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, I put your jingly keys on a high shelf, maybe for the future. Or for my wife to find when we clean up the house. What was supposed to be a good thing, turned out to be a bad thing. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
