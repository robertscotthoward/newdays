  <h2>Sumarry:</h2>
  <p>
  This is my final album cover design! It took me about an hour to get the layout figured out, but overall, I'm happy with it. <br>
  My cover is a black and white face with New Day on each side. It represents me because well, 1. Its literally my face. <br>
  2. It has NEW DAY on the sides of it, Day is my nickname, New Day is the Danish translation from Dagny, Slovak origins, and I am 25% Slovak. <br> 
  3. It has a static filter (Thanks to photoshop) Which represents me because I think It looks cool, and I love older movies/shows. It reminds me of them. <br>
  I think this cover looks pretty simple, but I worked really hard on figuring out the layout and how to edit IN photoshop. (And I learned a lot too hehe) <br>
  I think If I could do something different, I would have experimented with more font types, but It only had a couple preset ones so I worked with what I had. <br>
   Besides that, I think everything was successful!
